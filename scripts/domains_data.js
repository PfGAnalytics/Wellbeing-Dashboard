This indicator measures the delivery of the DoH’s policy objective to provide services which support adults with care needs to live independently in their own homes and which delay or avoid the need for provision of institutional care. It measures the number of people being provided with care at home comparative to the overall number of people identified as having a social care need and whose needs are not being met through provision of social care services in their own home. This indicator is important for monitoring the effectiveness of social care services in meeting the needs of the population, and for identifying areas where additional support may be required to meet the needs of those who are not currently receiving services, all of which can inform policy and resource allocation decisions.",
