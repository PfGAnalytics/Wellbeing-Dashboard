                    <p>To measure this, we have developed a set of indicators composed of Official and National Statistics. By looking at the evidence provided by these indicators, we can gain valuable insights into Northern Ireland's wellbeing, the areas where we are making progress, and the areas where progress still needs to be made.</p>
                    <p>Analysing these indicators across different parts of our society can help us uncover any inequalities and focus on areas that need attention. Policy makers, service providers and researchers can use this information to tackle issues, inform their own research and guide decisions. With this clearer understanding, we can create positive changes that benefit everyone.</p>

The assessment of performance is made objectively and impartially by a panel of senior analysts in the Northern Ireland Government. Decisions on performance are made independently of Ministers.</p>

                <h3>Development of the Programme for Government Wellbeing Framework</h3>
                <p>In 2021, the Northern Ireland Executive consulted on an Outcomes Framework for a Programme for Government. That Outcomes Framework set out a list of areas on which the Executive was considering focusing on in the coming years.</p>
                <p>The framework was to be underpinned by a robust set of Official and National Statistics which would help policy makers understand population wellbeing in Northern Ireland. Where problems or issues existed, that framework would help the Executive identify and respond to them. The methodology used learnings from the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and other international initiatives aimed at understanding wellbeing.</p>
                <p>This Wellbeing Dashboard was informed by and builds on this process and sets out population level wellbeing in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p>By keeping track of this information, we can understand our current situation, monitor progress, and address the most important priorities, including the global Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations.</p>
                <p>Analysing these measures across different parts of our society can help us uncover any inequalities and focus on areas needing attention. Policy makers, service providers and researchers can use this information to tackle issues, inform their own research and guide decisions. With this clearer understanding, we can create positive changes that benefit everyone.</p>
                <h3>Framework structure</h3>
                <p>To capture the diverse elements that contribute to Northern Ireland's social, economic, and environmental wellbeing, we have identified nine strategic domains of wellbeing. These domains describe our state of wellbeing as a society and align with the Executive's stated Missions: People, Planet, Prosperity.</p>
                <div id = "framework-container">
                    <div id = "framework-structure"></div>
                </div>
                <p>Each domain is supported by a number of indicators taken from Official and National Statistics, and while indicators are included under a particular domain, it is expected that many indicators may influence aspects of wellbeing relevant to multiple domains, and wellbeing overall.  We will update each indicator as additional data becomes available, providing a snapshot of Northern Ireland's state of wellbeing.</p>
                <h3>Quality characteristics of the framework</h3>
                <p>All of the indicators are composed of Official and National statistics which adhere to the <a href = "https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/" target = "_blank">Code of Practice for Statistics</a>.  The Code is based on three pillars - Trustworthiness, Quality and Value.  It outlines principles and practices to follow when producing statistics to ensure high quality, reliable outputs.</p>
                <p>The indicators have been identified in collaboration with departmental statisticians and policy colleagues to ensure they are relevant to wellbeing in NI.</p>
                <p>Each indicator is also subject to assessment by a Technical Assessment Panel comprising senior statisticians and economists within the NI Civil Service.  The panel consider the technical quality of a proposed indicator and determine overall suitability.  The Technical Assessment Panel also set baselines and criteria for determining whether change has occurred over time for each indicator.  These are set as each indicator is approved, in advance of reporting on the indicator to help ensure objective and transparent reporting on progress, independent of ministers.</p>
                <p>We will regularly review the indicators to ensure they remain relevant and appropriate and have processes in place for new indicators to be developed and existing indicators amended or removed as need be.</p>
                <h3>Collecting the data</h3>
                <p>Indicator data is produced by departmental statisticians who also Quality Assure the data and undertake analysis.  We will work in collaboration with statisticians across the NICS, to collate the relevant indicator data and publish it on the NISRA Data Portal and this dashboard.</p>
                <p>NI level data and data for Local Government Districts and Assembly Areas (where available and appropriate) will be published on this dashboard.  Additional data for Section 75 groups and deprivation will be published on the NISRA Data Portal (where available and appropriate), where the NI and geographical data can also be accessed in table form.  The indicator suite is diverse, with data coming from a wide range of sources, with different collection periods. This means that different information is available for each indicator and some indicators relate to NI only. <strong>Please use caution when making comparisons between measures and over time. Please also consider the potential impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on data collection and scores.</strong></p>
                <p>For further information on the quality of each indicator, you can consult the source publications (links provided on the dashboard and NISRA Data Portal).  These publications include technical information specific to the data reported and are also supported by Background Quality Reports.</p>
                <h3>Reporting on progress</h3>
                <p>Performance is assessed by comparing the most recent data point for an indicator with the baseline figure.  Criteria for determining change are set when each indicator is approved for inclusion in the PfG Wellbeing Framework.</p>
                <p>Where the threshold for a positive change is met or exceeded, an 'improving' trend will be reported.  Where the threshold for a negative change is met or exceeded, a 'worsening' trend will be reported. Where the threshold for change is not met, 'no change' will be reported.  Further information, including the baseline and criteria for reporting change for each indicator, is provided in our Technical Report (link).</p>
                <p>The assessment of performance is made objectively and impartially by a panel of senior analysts in the Northern Ireland Government. Decisions on performance are made independently of Ministers.  This assessment relates to the NI level data only.</p>
                <h3>Future development</h3>
                <p>We will engage with stakeholders and users to gather feedback on this dashboard and the indicator tables on the NISRA Data Portal.</p>
                <p>There will be ongoing development of the indicator set to identify and address any potential gaps, and to improve or replace existing measures as need be.</p>
                <p>We are keen to hear from users of the dashboard and you can contact us at <a href = "mailto:pfganalytics@executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk">pfganalytics@executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk</a> or complete our short <a href = "https://consultations.nidirect.gov.uk/teo/d8cf2dfc" target = "_blank">user survey</a> if you have any feedback.</p>
