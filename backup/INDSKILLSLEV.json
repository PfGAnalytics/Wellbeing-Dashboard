Since the onset of the pandemic, the ONS have been monitoring the impact and as a result, there have been five LFS reweightings to improve the estimates. The latest reweighting was introduced in December 2024, affecting data from January-March 2019 to July-September 2024 to make use of more recent population estimates. An overview of the impact of reweighting on the NI estimates of unemployment, employment, and economic inactivity is available on the [url=https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/background-information-lfs]NISRA website[/url]. Previous reweightings occurred in October 2020, July 2021, June 2022 and February 2024. The proportion of people qualified to level 2 and above in 2020 and 2021 was similar to the proportions seen before the pandemic.\r\n\r\n[b]Further information[/b]\r\n1. Level 2 and above qualifications include: Level 2 - O-level, GCSE grade A*-C or equivalent - 5 or more, Level 3 - A-level or equivalent - more than 1, Level 4 to 5 - Foundation degree, HNC/HND/BTEC higher, and Level 6 - First degree or higher.\r\n2. A methodology document on Highest Qualification Levels is available on the LFS background information quality page (linked below), which provides a fuller explanation of methodology and more detail on qualifications included in all levels.\r\n[url=https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/background-information-lfs]Background Information - LFS | Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (nisra.gov.uk) [/url]",
