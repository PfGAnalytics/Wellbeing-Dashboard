      "[b]Income inequality\r\n\r\nHow do we measure this?[/b]\r\nPercentage of people living in relative poverty (before housing costs).\r\n\r\n[b]Source[/b]\r\nNorthern Ireland Poverty and Income Inequality Report, Department for Communities\r\n[url=https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/topics/family-resources-survey]https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/topics/family-resources-survey[/url]\r\n[b]\r\nImpact of Covid-19[/b]\r\nData collection in 2020/21 and 2021/22 was impacted by COVID-19 restrictions resulting in a move to telephone interviewing and a reduced sample size. This led to additional uncertainty around the estimates, particularly for smaller groups. As such, for 2020/21, only figures relating to the whole population in NI are presented in this dashboard. In 2022/23 and 2023/24 a mix of face to face and telephone interviews were employed. Changes in estimates over recent years should be interpreted being mindful of the differences in data collection approaches across the period and the effect this had on sample composition, with longer term trends often giving a clearer picture.\r\n\r\n[b]Further Information[/b]\r\n1. LGD Information provided by 3 year averages rather than individual year due to small sample sizes.\r\n2. The 2018/19-2021/22 and 2019/20-2022/23 data currently covers a 4 year period but data for 2020/21 has been omitted due to a greatly reduced sample size for that year."
