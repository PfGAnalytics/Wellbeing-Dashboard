    "note": "[b]School leavers attainment gap[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]How do we measure this?[/b]\r\nGap between the percentage of non-free school meal entitled (non-FSME) school leavers and the percentage of free school meals entitled (FSME) school leavers achieving at level 2 or above including GCSE English and maths. Level 2 relates to the attainment of at least 5 GCSEs at grades A*-C (including equivalents). For this indicator a lower figure is better.\r\n\r\n[b]Source[/b]\r\nQualifications and Destinations of School Leavers, Department of Education\r\n[url=https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/school-leavers]https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/school-leavers[/url] \r\n\r\n[b]Impact of Covid-19[/b]\r\nIn response to the pandemic, while the data collection method remained the same, the processes for awarding qualifications were amended, or assessment adaptations or other supports provided, from year-to-year, for 2019/20 to 2022/23. It is not possible to accurately make comparisons and assess change in the underlying performance for these years.\r\n\r\n[b]Further information[/b]\r\n1. Data exclude special and independent schools.\r\n2. There was an increase in the number of FSME pupils from 2014/15 which coincided with an extension of the eligibility for free school meals under the Working Tax Credit free school meal criterion, which was extended to post-primary pupils from September 2014.\r\n3. The percentage points (ppts) gap is calculated based on unrounded figures. It is not the difference between the rounded FSME and non-FSME figures.\r\n4. Given the new methods of awarding grades in 2019/20 (Centre Assessed Grades), 2020/21 (Centre Determined Grades), 2021/22 (various assessment adaptations) and 2022/23 (other supports, including Advance Information), caution should be taken when drawing any conclusions relating to changes in student performance. Year-on-year changes in these years are not directly comparable with outcomes in any other years.\r\n\r\n[b]Religion[/b]\r\n5. 'Other' includes Other Christian, No religion and Non-Christian.\r\n\r\n[b]Ethnic group [/b] \r\n6. 'Minority Ethnic Groups' includes Irish Travellers. 'White' does not include Irish Travellers.\r\n\r\n[b]Deprivation[/b]\r\n7. Deprivation quintiles are based on the residential postcode of each individual pupil. Figures up to and including 2017/18 were calculated from the 2010 Multiple Deprivation Measure deciles (NIMDM); from 2018/19 onwards figures have been calculated using the 2017 NIMDM deciles.\r\nMore information on the NI Multiple Deprivation Measures can be found here:\r\n[url=https://www.nisra.gov.uk/statistics/deprivation]https://www.nisra.gov.uk/statistics/deprivation[/url] \r\n8. Data exclude pupils with an invalid, missing or unknown residential postcode.\r\n\r\n[b]Urban Rural[/b]\r\n9. Urban/ Rural categories are based on the residential postcode of each individual pupil and the 2015 Settlement Urban/ Rural geographical boundaries. More information on Urban Rural classifications can be found here: [url=https://www.nisra.gov.uk/support/geography/urban-rural-classification]https://www.nisra.gov.uk/support/geography/urban-rural-classification[/url] \r\n10. Data exclude pupils with an invalid, missing or unknown residential postcode.\r\n\r\n[b]Special Educational Needs (SEN)[/b]\r\n11. 'Special Educational Needs' includes pupils with Special Educational Needs at stages 1 through 3. Prior to 2020/21, when the number of stages were reduced from five to three, it included pupils at stages 1 through 5.\r\n12. Data on Special Educational Needs (SEN) are not available for 2018/19 as a consequence of changes to the system of recording SEN and medical conditions.\r\n13. Categorisation of Special Educational Needs (SEN) from 2019/20 follows changes to the system of recording SEN and medical conditions. Previously, pupils with solely a medical condition could have been included as SEN pupils. From 2019/20 this is no longer the case and the data are, therefore, not directly comparable with previous years.",
