This led to additional uncertainty around the estimates, particularly for smaller groups. As such, for 2020/21, only figures relating to the whole population in NI are presented in this dashboard. In 2022/23 a mix of face to face and telephone interviews were employed. Changes in estimates over recent years should be interpreted being mindful of the differences in data collection approaches across the period and the effect this had on sample composition, with longer term trends often giving a clearer picture. \r\n[b]\r\nFurther Information[/b] \r\n1. Some figures are not available due to small sample sizes. \r\n2. LGD Information provided by 3 year averages rather than individual year due to small sample sizes. \r\n3. The 2018/19-2021/22 data currently covers a 4 year period but data for 2020/21 has been omitted due to a greatly reduced sample size for that year. \r\n4. Information provided is based on the head of the household.",
