For 2020/21 and 2021/22 data collection was by telephone interviewing due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. There was also a reduction in the number of questions between 2020/21-2022/23. As a result, the figures from 2020/21 onwards are not directly comparable to previous years due to the significant changes to the survey in terms of methodology and content.\r\n\r\n[b]Further Information[/b]\r\n1. Sport & physical activity is defined as the percentage of adults (aged 16+) participating in sport & physical activity within the last 4 weeks (including walking).\r\n2. A question relating to sport and physical activity within the last 4 weeks was not included in the CHS 2020/21.\r\n3. Following a move in 2020/21 from face-to-face interviewing to telephone interviewing to collect data, due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, data collection for the Continuous Household Surveys 2021/22 to 2023/24 used a mix of telephone and face-to-face modes. \r\n4. Results from 2021/22 to 2023/24 are not directly comparable to previous years due to the significant changes to the survey in terms of methodology and content.\r\n5. While comparisons can be made between 2021/22 and 2022/23 and 2023/24, it is important to note that participating in sport and physical activity in 2021/22 would have been impacted by closures due to COVID-19.\r\n6. Published figures for 2017/18 to 2019/20 were revised on 29 June 2023:\r\n[url=https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/publications/engagement-culture-arts-heritage-and-sport-adults-northern-irelands-local-government-districts-2022]Engagement in culture, arts, heritage and sport by adults in Northern Irelandâ€™s local government districts 2022 | Department for Communities (communities-ni.gov.uk)[/url]."
