For this indicator a lower figure is better.\r\n\r\n[b]Source[/b]\r\nIndividual Wellbeing among young people in Northern Ireland, The Executive Office\r\n[url=https://www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk/topics/individual-wellbeing-among-young-people-northern-ireland]Individual Wellbeing among young people in Northern Ireland | The Executive Office (executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk)[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]Impact of Covid-19[/b]\r\nThe Young Person's Behaviour and Attitude Survey methodology did not change during or after COVID-19.\r\n\r\n[b]Further information[/b]\r\n1. Data relates to Year 9-12 pupils.\r\n2. All estimates are based on weighted data and have been rounded to one decimal place.\r\n3. Data is collected through the [url=https://www.nisra.gov.uk/statistics/find-your-survey/young-persons-behaviour-attitudes-survey]Young Persons’ Behaviour and Attitudes Survey (YPBAS)[/url]. The survey is usually carried out every three years.\r\n\r\n[b]Religion[/b]\r\n4. ‘Other' includes those who stated a religion other than Catholic and Protestant, those who stated no religion, those who refused to answer the question, and those whose answer was missing.\r\n\r\n[b]Disability[/b]\r\n5. For this indicator, ‘disability’ is measured using ‘limiting long-standing illness’. Respondents are defined as having a limiting long standing illness if they have any physical or mental health conditions or illnesses lasting or expected to last for 12 months or more, and the condition(s) or illness(es) reduce their ability to carry out day to day.\r\n\r\n[b]Ethnic group[/b]\r\n6. 'Other' includes: 'Irish Traveller'; 'White and Black Caribbean'; 'White and Black African'; 'White and Asian'; 'Any other mixed/multiple ethnic background'; 'Indian'; 'Pakistani'; 'Bangladeshi'; 'Chinese'; 'Any other Asian background'; 'African'; 'Caribbean'; 'Any other Black/African/Caribbean background'; 'Arab'; and 'Any other ethnic group'.\r\n7. Figures for 'Other' in 2016 have been suppressed due to small sample sizes (less than 100 respondents).\r\n\r\n[b]Deprivation[/b]\r\n8. All figures up to and including 2016/17 are defined according to the 2010 NIMDM; figures from 2017/18 onwards are based on the 2017 NIMDM. More information on the NI Multiple Deprivation Measures can be found here: [url=https://www.nisra.gov.uk/statistics/deprivation]https://www.nisra.gov.uk/statistics/deprivation[/url]. \r\n\r\n[b]Urban Rural[/b]\r\n9. All figures are defined according to the 2015 urban rural classification. More information on Urban Rural classifications can be found here: [url=https://www.nisra.gov.uk/support/geography/urban-rural-classification]https://www.nisra.gov.uk/support/geography/urban-rural-classification[/url].",
