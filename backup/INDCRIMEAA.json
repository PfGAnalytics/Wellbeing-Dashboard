This resulted in a break in the time series. The change reduced the sample size, particularly for 2020/21. Results for the three latest years are not directly comparable with previous sweeps.\r\n\r\n[b]Further Information[/b]\r\n1. The prevalence rate is the estimated percentage of adults who have been a victim of at least one personal crime or have been resident in a household that was a victim of at least one household crime.\r\n2. The Northern Ireland Safe Community Survey was previously known as the NI Crime Survey. Given the change in survey mode as a result of the pandemic, the survey years from 2020/21 are referenced as the Northern Ireland Safe Community Telephone Survey.\r\n3. Previously conducted on an ad hoc basis, the survey began operating on a continuous basis in January 2005.\r\n5. Figures for 2020/21 are not included as a result of the reduced sample size.\r\n6. Data is not available prior to 2018/19 as Assembly Area breakdown was not included in the data prior to this.",
