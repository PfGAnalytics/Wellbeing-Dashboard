This resulted in a break in the time series. The change reduced the sample size, particularly for 2020/21. Results for the three latest years are not directly comparable with previous sweeps.\r\n\r\n[b]Further information[/b] \r\n1. The Northern Ireland Safe Community Survey was previously known as the NI Crime Survey. Given the change in survey mode as a result of the pandemic, the survey years from 2020/21 are referenced as the Northern Ireland Safe Community Telephone Survey. \r\n2. Previously conducted on an ad hoc basis, the survey began operating on a continuous basis in January 2005. \r\n3. Results exclude don't knows and refusals."
