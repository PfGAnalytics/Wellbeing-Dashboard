      "[b]School leavers attainment gap[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]How do we measure this?[/b]\r\nGap between the percentage of non-free school meal entitled (non-FSME) school leavers and the percentage of free school meals entitled (FSME) school leavers achieving at level 2 or above including GCSE English and maths. Level 2 relates to the attainment of at least 5 GCSEs at grades A*-C (including equivalents). For this indicator a lower figure is better.\r\n\r\n[b]Source[/b]\r\nQualifications and Destinations of School Leavers, Department of Education\r\n[url=https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/school-leavers]https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/school-leavers[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]Impact of Covid-19[/b]\r\nIn response to the pandemic, while the data collection method remained the same, the processes for awarding qualifications were amended, or assessment adaptations or other supports provided, from year-to-year, for 2019/20 to 2022/23. It is not possible to accurately make comparisons and assess change in the underlying performance for these years.\r\n\r\n[b]Further information[/b]\r\n1. Data exclude special and independent schools.\r\n2. There was an increase in the number of FSME pupils from 2014/15 which coincided with an extension of the eligibility for free school meals under the Working Tax Credit free school meal criterion, which was extended to post-primary pupils from September 2014.\r\n3. The percentage points (ppts) gap is calculated based on unrounded figures. It is not the difference between the rounded FSME and non-FSME figures.\r\n4. Given the new methods of awarding grades in 2019/20 (Centre Assessed Grades), 2020/21 (Centre Determined Grades), 2021/22 (various assessment adaptations) and 2022/23 (other supports, including Advance Information), caution should be taken when drawing any conclusions relating to changes in student performance. Year-on-year changes in these years are not directly comparable with outcomes in any other years.\r\n5. Assembly Area of pupil residence is based on the residential postcode of each individual pupil and the 2008 Assembly Area geographical boundaries.\r\n6. Data exclude pupils with an invalid, missing or unknown residential postcode."
