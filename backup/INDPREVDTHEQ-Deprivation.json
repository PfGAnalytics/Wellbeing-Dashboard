For this indicator a lower figure is better.\r\n\r\n[b]Source[/b]\r\nHealth Inequalities Annual Report, Department of Health\r\n[url=https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/articles/health-inequalities-statistics]www.health-ni.gov.uk/articles/health-inequalities-statistics[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]Impact of Covid-19[/b]\r\nDeaths due to COVID-19 were introduced to the definition in 2020.\r\n\r\n[b]Further information[/b]\r\n1. The definition of 'preventable mortality' is based on the current Office for National Statistics (ONS) definition for avoidable mortality as proposed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This is calculated by standardising (using the direct method) the average death rate in Northern Ireland (over a five year period) due to preventable causes to the 2013 ESP. Defined as causes of death that can be mainly avoided through effective public health and primary prevention interventions (i.e. before the onset of diseases/injuries, to reduce incidence). \r\n[url=https://www.oecd.org/health/health-systems/Avoidable-mortality-2019-Joint-OECD-Eurostat-List-preventable-treatable-causes-of-death.pdf]www.oecd.org/health/health-systems/Avoidable-mortality-2019-Joint-OECD-Eurostat-List-preventable-treatable-causes-of-death.pdf[/url]\r\n2.
